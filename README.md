# Userlist for Ruby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/userlistio/userlist-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/userlistio/userlist-ruby)

This gem helps with integrating [Userlist](http://userlist.com) into Ruby applications.

> To integrate Userlist into Ruby on Rails application, please use [userlist-rails](https://github.com/userlistio/userlist-rails)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'userlist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install userlist

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the Push API key. You can get your Push API key via the [Push API settings](https://app.userlist.com/settings/push) in your Userlist account.

Configuration values can either be set via the `Userlist.configure` method or as environment variables. The environment take precedence over configuration values from the initializer.

Configuration via environment variables:

```shell
USERLIST_PUSH_KEY=VvB7pjDrv0V2hoaOCeZ5rIiUEPbEhSUN
USERLIST_PUSH_ID=6vPkJl44cm82y4aLBIzaOhuEHJd0Bm7b
```

Configuration via an initializer:

```ruby
Userlist.configure do |config|
  config.push_key = 'VvB7pjDrv0V2hoaOCeZ5rIiUEPbEhSUN'
  config.push_id = '6vPkJl44cm82y4aLBIzaOhuEHJd0Bm7b'
end
```

The possible configuration values are listed in the table below.

| Name | Default value | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `push_key` | `nil` | The push key for your account. See [Push API settings](https://app.userlist.com/settings/push). |
| `push_id` | `nil` | The push id for your account. See [Push API settings](https://app.userlist.com/settings/push). |
| `push_endpoint` | `https://push.userlist.com/` | The HTTP endpoint that the library will send data to. |
| `push_strategy` | `:threaded` | The strategy to use to send data to the HTTP endpoint. Possible values are `:threaded`, `:direct`, and `:null`.
| `log_level` | `:warn` | The log level for Userlist related log messages. Possible values are `:debug |, :error, :fatal, :info, and :warn
| `token_lifetime` | `3600` | The lifetime of generated in-app messages tokens in seconds |


### Disabling in development and test environments

As sending test and development data into data into Userlist isn't very desirable, you can disable transmissions by setting the push strategy to `:null`.

```ruby
Userlist.configure do |config|
  config.push_strategy = :null
end
```

## Usage

### Tracking Users

To manually send user data into Userlist, use the `Userlist::Push.users.push` method.

```ruby
Userlist::Push.users.push(
  identifier: 'user-1',
  email: 'foo@example.com',
  properties: {
    first_name: 'Foo',
    last_name: 'Example'
  }
})
```

It's also possible to delete a user from Userlist, using the `Userlist::Push.users.delete` method.

```ruby
Userlist::Push.users.delete('user-1')
```


### Tracking Events

To track custom events use the `Userlist::Push.events.push` method.

```ruby
Userlist::Push.events.push(
  name: 'project_created',
  user: 'user-1',
  properties: {
    project_name: 'Example project'
  }
)
```


### Tokens for in-app messages

In order to use in-app messages, you must create a JWT token for the currently signed in user on the server side. To do this, please configure both the `push_key` and the `push_id` configuration variables. Afterwards, you can use the `Userlist::Token.generate` method to get a signed token for the given user identifier.

```ruby
Userlist::Token.generate('user-1')
# => "eyJraWQiOiI2dlBrSmw0NGNtODJ5NGFMQkl6YU9odU...kPGe8KX8JZBTQ"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
